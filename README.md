## Footnotes
- DigiTerminal is my first ever coding project. I wrote it entirely in Python and used the Selenium Python library for interaction with the website. I'm open to suggestions for future updates and feature additions.
- Yes, I know writing out all of your code in one file is generally frowned upon, but DigiTerminal is pretty small, and I saw no reason to separate anything here.
- I really wanted to be able to use Firefox for this, but the Chrome webdriver is easier to use and has better support, so this is written to be used with Google Chrome.
- To my knowledge, most users on Digibutter are mainly mobile users, so I'm currious to hear if anyone plans to check this out.
- To anyone wondering, Just a Normal Question Mark Block Who Likes to Post "Test" was me using DigiTerminal. He's going to hatch out of his ? Block one day and become NerrBot: Rehatched.
- Spoiler alert: NerrBot: Rehatched will run on a modified version of DigiTerminal. That's the reason why I wrote all of this...
- Last thing: To anyone who stumbled upon this project and has no idea what this is: Come check out digibutter.nerr.biz. It's Hi-Technicaaal!
