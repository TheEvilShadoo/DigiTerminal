# DigiTerminal
DigiTerminal is both a testing framework for the Digibutter 3.0 API and a prototype of sorts for NerrBot: Rehatched. DigiTerminal allows for the automation of certain tasks on the digibutter.nerr.biz website.

**Check out help.md for both the required dependencies AND _simple_ info on how to run the source files if you're new to Python.**

## Footnotes
- DigiTerminal is my first ever actual coding project. I wrote it entirely in Python and used the Selenium Python library for interaction with the website.
- Yes, I know writing out all of your code in one file is generally frowned upon, but DigiTerminal is small, and I saw no reason to separate anything here.
- I really wanted to allow users to be able to use the Firefox webdriver for DigiTerminal, but the Chrome webdriver is easier to use and has better support, so this is written to be used with the Google Chrome webdriver.
- NerrBot: Rehatched will be almost **entirely** different from DigiTerminal. The reason why I wrote all of this was to get a starting point for writing code.
- To my knowledge, most users on Digibutter are mainly mobile users, so I doubt anyone will actually use this. Again, it's just for me to get a foothold for writing NerrBot: RH.
- To anyone who missed out on my announcement, Just a Normal Question Mark Block Who Likes to Post "Test" was me using DigiTerminal. He's going to hatch out of his ? Block one day and become NerrBot: Rehatched.
- Last thing: To anyone who stumbled upon this project and has no idea what this is: Come check out digibutter.nerr.biz. It's Hi-Technicaaal!
