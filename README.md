# DigiTerminal
DigiTerminal is both a testing framework for the Digibutter 3.0 API and a prototype of sorts for NerrBot: Rehatched. DigiTerminal allows for the automation of certain tasks on the http://digibutter.nerr.biz website.

**Check out help.md for both the required dependencies AND _simple_ info on how to run the source files if you're new to Python.**

## Footnotes
- DigiTerminal is my first ever actual coding project. I wrote it entirely in Python and used the Selenium Python library for interaction with the website.
- NerrBot: Rehatched will be almost **entirely** different from DigiTerminal. The reason why I wrote all of this was just to find a sort of starting point for writing code.
- To my knowledge, most current users on Digibutter are mainly mobile users, so I doubt that anyone other than myself will ever actually use this. Again, it's just for me to get a foothold for writing NerrBot: ReHatched.
- To anyone who missed out on my announcement, Just a Normal Question Mark Block Who Likes to Post "Test" was me using DigiTerminal. He's going to hatch out of his ? Block one day and become NerrBot: Rehatched.
- Last thing: To anyone who's randomly stumbled upon this project and has no idea what this is all about: Come check out http://digibutter.nerr.biz. It's Hi-Technicaaal!
